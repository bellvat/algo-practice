#find longest common prefix among an array of strings
#['thestr','thestabc','thebca','abcba'] --> longest would be 'thest'
#common just means more than one..
#hash table..? I need to store the whole word..
#pointers? i,j
#just 2 loops, one for min length, and another to loop through each element and compare
